## ðŸ”§ Step-by-Step Plan

### 1. Configure Spoke Route Tables

Each **Spoke subnet** should have a custom UDR:

| Route | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Destination | `0.0.0.0/0` |
| Next Hop | Azure Firewall private IP |

Attach this route table to each workload subnet in both Spoke 1 and Spoke 2.

---

### 2. Azure Firewall SNAT Configuration

Configure Azure Firewall to **SNAT Spoke traffic to different IPs**, so that your **on-premises edge router** can distinguish the traffic:

| Traffic Source | SNAT to |
|----------------|---------|
| Spoke 1        | `10.0.0.10` (Firewall IP A) |
| Spoke 2        | `10.0.0.20` (Firewall IP B) |

> These are outbound SNAT IPs that your **edge router will use to apply policy routing**.

You can define SNAT rules in the **Azure Firewall Policy**, or rely on default SNAT behavior with custom IPs per spoke using IP groups.

---

### 3. On-Premises Edge Router Policy Routing

At your on-prem router where both **ExpressRoute circuits terminate**:

- If source = `10.0.0.10` â†’ route via **ExpressRoute 1**
- If source = `10.0.0.20` â†’ route via **ExpressRoute 2**

This enables **source-based routing**, even though Azure itself can't do that internally.

---

### 4. BGP + ExpressRoute Global Reach (Optional)

If you're using **ExpressRoute Global Reach**:

- Enable it between ER1 and ER2
- This allows your **Hub to reach both circuits** via your on-prem environment

This way, you can have **one VNet Gateway in the Hub**, but send traffic to either circuit by letting **on-prem handle the path**.

---

## âœ… Summary

| Requirement | Solution |
|-------------|----------|
| Centralized firewall | Azure Firewall in the Hub |
| Different egress ER paths | Handle using SNAT + on-prem routing |
| Single Hub VNet | Supported |
| Multiple ER circuits | Handled at edge (not within single VNet) |
| Spoke-level control | Done via route tables + Firewall SNAT |
| Source-based routing | Done outside Azure (on-premises) |

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- **Monitor effective routes** with **Azure Network Watcher** to verify UDRs and next hops.
- Ensure **NSGs allow** all required traffic between spokes, Hub, and ExpressRoute Gateways.
- Consider using **Azure Route Server** + **BGP** in advanced designs with NVAs.

---

## ðŸ§ª Validation

- Use **Network Watcher > IP Flow Verify** to check traffic flow
- Enable **Azure Firewall diagnostic logs** to confirm SNAT behavior
- On on-prem routers, check flow logs to confirm source IP-based routing is applied as expected
