That link was just a placeholder/example and **does not exist**â€”I apologize for any confusion!  
You should **copy and paste the code** from my previous message directly into your script.  
There is no actual Gist at that URL.

### **What to do:**

1. **Find this section** in your script (in `main()`):

   ```python
   for subscription in subscriptions:
       subscription_id = subscription.subscription_id
       subscription_data = {
           'subscription_id': subscription_id,
           'subscription_name': subscription.display_name,
           'vnets': []
       }
       
       vnets_data = get_vnets_and_subnets(subscription_id, credential)
       subscription_data['vnets'] = vnets_data
       all_network_data.append(subscription_data)
   ```

2. **Replace it with this:**

   ```python
   for subscription in subscriptions:
       subscription_id = subscription.subscription_id
       subscription_name = subscription.display_name

       # --- SKIP "DELETED" SUBSCRIPTIONS ---
       if "DELETED" in subscription_name.upper():
           logger.info(f"Skipping subscription '{subscription_name}' ({subscription_id}) because it is marked as DELETED.")
           continue
       # ------------------------------------

       subscription_data = {
           'subscription_id': subscription_id,
           'subscription_name': subscription_name,
           'vnets': []
       }
       
       vnets_data = get_vnets_and_subnets(subscription_id, credential)
       subscription_data['vnets'] = vnets_data
       all_network_data.append(subscription_data)
   ```

3. **Save and run your script.**

---

**Result:**  
Any subscription with `"DELETED"` in its name will be skipped and not synced to NetBox.

If you want a full script file with this change, let me know and I can provide it as a downloadable file or paste the entire script here.
